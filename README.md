How it works:
1. Add your API Key for OpenAI to your OS environment variables.
2. Run the program (python main.py).
3. Ask a question using your microphone.
4. OpenAI API should respond with a text response.
5. The text response should be converted to audio.
5. you can then ask another question. 
6. stop the program by saying 'stop'.




Note:

This version is not stable and full of bugs.

There is no conversation history, although there is plan to implement this.
